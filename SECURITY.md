## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software products seriously.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any h2ouw8n4-owned repository, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to [Derek](https://github.com/h2ouw8n4) privately.

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

Reports should include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact if left unaddressed

Upon receipt of a security issue, we will endeavor to understand, confirm, and classify the issue. Once we have done that, we will work on releasing a mitigation as soon as we can, typically in the form of a security update.

We will notify you when the security update addressing the issue is available.
